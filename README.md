# wcbn-ios

This is the mobile app for WCBN, the student-run radio station at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. The app can be used to stream the radio live, contact the DJs, save songs, and more. This app is made to replace its predecessor that became obsolete after WCBN retired its web backend, Readback.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the machine, create a new directory for the Git repo, navigate to it, and run $ `git clone https://github.com/coxtrent/wcbn-ios.git`.



### Prerequisites

This project is an iOS app and requires MacOS and Xcode to properly simulate and debug the app. You may need to install Xcode Command line tools by opening a shell and running $ `xcode-select --install`, and you also may need to install the macOS and iOS development tools when prompted at the time of first opening Xcode.


### Installing

#TODO: Finish this step-by-step guide to creating an Xcode iOS app project from an existing repo. If you already know how to do that -- nice! If you don't -- figure out, buddy!


## Usage

After configuring Xcode and opening the project, choose a compatible simulation device and press the play button. It will open an app simulator.
